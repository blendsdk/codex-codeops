# Phase 3 Authoring: Templates & Rules

> Read this when authoring requirement documents (after the Zero-Ambiguity Gate
> has passed). Contains the output structure, the README template, the universal

## How to Use These Documents

Each requirements document is designed to be used with the make-plan skill:

1. Pick a requirements document (e.g., RD-01)
2. Run the make-plan skill
3. The plan system uses the RD as input to create implementation plans
4. Run the exec-plan skill for the feature
5. Implement iteratively
```

## 3.3 Universal RD Template

Every requirement document follows this structure:

````markdown

> **Document**: RD-XX-[feature-name].md
> **Status**: Draft
> **Created**: [Date]
> **Project**: [Project Name]
> **Depends On**: [List of RD dependencies, or "—" if none]
> **CodeOps Skills Version**: 3.12.0

## Feature Overview

[1–2 paragraphs: what this feature does and why it's needed, written so someone
unfamiliar with the project can understand the purpose.]

---

## Functional Requirements

### Must Have
- [ ] [Requirement — specific, testable, implementable]

### Should Have
- [ ] [Requirement]

### Won't Have (Out of Scope)
- [Explicitly excluded item] — [reason or which RD covers it]

---

## Technical Requirements

### [Sub-section per major technical concern]

[Architecture details, data structures, interfaces, algorithms, protocols.
Include pseudocode or real code examples where clarity demands it. Include tables
for structured information (env vars, config keys, API endpoints).]

---

## Integration Points

### With RD-XX ([Name])
- [How this requirement connects to that one]

---

## Scope Decisions

| Decision | Options Considered | Chosen | Rationale | AR Ref |
|----------|-------------------|--------|-----------|--------|
| [Decision] | [Option A, B, C] | [Chosen] | [Why] | AR #X |

> **Traceability:** Every scope decision must reference the Ambiguity Register
> entry (AR #) that resolved it. See `00-ambiguity-register.md`.

---

## Security Considerations

> **🚨 This section is MANDATORY for every RD.** See your project's security
> coding standards (AGENTS.md).

- **Data sensitivity**: [What sensitive data does this feature handle? PII, credentials, tokens, financial data?]
- **Input validation**: [What user inputs exist? How are they validated and sanitized?]
- **Authentication & authorization**: [Who can access this feature? What permissions are required?]
- **Injection risks**: [SQL queries, HTML rendering, shell commands, or file operations involving user input?]
- **Encryption needs**: [Does data need encryption at rest or in transit?]
- **Rate limiting**: [Endpoints susceptible to brute force or abuse?]
- **Infrastructure**: [Container hardening, secrets management, network exposure?]

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. [ ] [Testable criterion]
2. [ ] [Testable criterion]
3. [ ] Security requirements verified (input validation, injection prevention, auth, encryption)
````

## 3.4 RD Authoring Guidelines

- **Data Model Sketches**: for domain RDs, include conceptual entity relationships (not full SQL, but "A Project has many Participants. A Lab has many Equipment items.").
- **Security & Privacy Annotations**: flag PII, encryption needs, consent tracking, GDPR relevance.
- **Complexity Estimates**: tag each requirement section with estimated complexity (S/M/L/XL) to aid planning.
- **Non-Functional RD (always)**: create one dedicated RD for non-functional requirements (performance targets, security, scalability, accessibility, availability, backup/recovery). Users frequently forget these.

## 3.4B 🚨 Acceptance Criteria Specificity — NON-NEGOTIABLE

**Acceptance criteria MUST be specific enough that a developer who has never
spoken to the user can write a correct test from the criterion alone.** This
prevents the acceptance-criteria tautology — where vague criteria let later tests
interpret them however the implementation happens to work, creating a
self-validating loop.

**Every acceptance criterion MUST meet ALL of these:**

1. **Measurable outcome** — a concrete, observable result (not "works correctly").
2. **Specific values** — exact numbers, formats, status codes, or field names where applicable.
3. **Standard references** — when behavior must conform to a standard (RFC, protocol, spec), cite the specific standard and section (e.g., "per RFC 8414 §2", not "follows the OIDC spec").
4. **Boundary conditions** — what happens at the edges (empty input, maximum length, zero items, expired tokens).
5. **Negative cases** — what should NOT happen / what should be rejected.

**Examples:**

```
❌ BAD: "The API returns a valid OIDC discovery document"
✅ GOOD: "GET /.well-known/openid-configuration returns a JSON document where the
   'issuer' field exactly matches the URL used to access the endpoint (per RFC
   8414 §2), and includes all REQUIRED fields: issuer, authorization_endpoint,
   token_endpoint, jwks_uri, response_types_supported, subject_types_supported,
   id_token_signing_alg_values_supported"

❌ BAD: "Users can reset their password"
✅ GOOD: "POST /auth/reset-password with a valid email returns 202 Accepted, sends
   an email with a one-time reset link that expires after 60 minutes, and the link
   cannot be reused after the password is changed"

❌ BAD: "The system handles invalid input gracefully"
✅ GOOD: "POST /api/users with a missing 'email' field returns 400 with
   { error: 'VALIDATION_ERROR', details: [{ field: 'email', message: '...' }] }.
   POST /api/users with an email longer than 254 characters returns 400."
```

**If the user gives vague acceptance criteria** during review, ask for specifics:
*"This criterion says 'handles errors properly' — what specific error conditions
should be handled, and what should the response look like for each?"*

**Traceability to tests:** when the make-plan skill later derives test cases from
these criteria, each spec test expectation MUST map directly to a specific
acceptance criterion. If a criterion is too vague to produce a concrete test
assertion, the criterion is defective — not the test.

## 3.5 Authoring Workflow

Write RDs one at a time, presenting each to the user for review:

1. Write RD-01 → present → collect feedback → revise.
2. Write RD-02 → present → collect feedback → revise.
3. Continue until all RDs are written.
4. If the session is getting long, save progress to `requirements/_draft/` and note which RDs remain (RDs are written to disk as completed — never held only in memory).
