# Phase 3 — Per-Document Re-evaluation Checklists (Reference)

The upgrade-plan skill links here. Use these checklists in Phase 3, after the Content Quality Gate
([content-quality-gate.md](content-quality-gate.md)) has passed. Apply the **plan checklists** when
upgrading `plans/[feature-name]/`, and the **requirements checklists** when upgrading
`requirements/`.

For every document: re-evaluate against current standards (the make-plan skill's current standards
for plans; the make-requirements skill's current standards for requirements), add the version stamp
`> **CodeOps Artifact Schema**: 1` where stamps belong, and write in any content fixes resolved
during Phase 2B with an `AR #` back-reference. Always honor the Content Preservation Rules in
SKILL.md — never destroy user work.
