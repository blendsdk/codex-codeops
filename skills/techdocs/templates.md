# techdocs — Document Templates (Phase 4)

> **CodeOps Skills Version**: 3.12.0

Canonical templates for every document in the VitePress `docs/` tree. Write a file from the
matching template, then fill the bracketed placeholders with real, verified project details. Only
create the sections relevant to the project type (see the adaptation table in SKILL.md). Replace
every `[YYYY-MM-DD]` "Last Updated" stamp with today's date when you write or update a file.

## `docs/decisions/index.md` — ADR log

````markdown
# Architecture Decision Records

This log tracks all significant architecture and design decisions made for [Project Name].
Each decision is documented with context, options considered, and rationale.

## Decision Log

| # | Date | Decision | Status |
|---|------|----------|--------|
| [ADR-001](ADR-001-short-name.md) | YYYY-MM-DD | [Brief title] | ✅ Accepted |
| [ADR-002](ADR-002-short-name.md) | YYYY-MM-DD | [Brief title] | ✅ Accepted |

## How to Read ADRs

Each ADR follows a standard format:
- **Context**: What situation or problem triggered this decision?
- **Decision**: What was decided?
- **Rationale**: Why was this chosen over alternatives?
- **Consequences**: What are the trade-offs and implications?

## When to Create an ADR

Create a new ADR when:
- Choosing a technology, framework, or library
- Deciding on an architecture pattern or style
- Choosing between multiple valid approaches
- Making a decision that would be hard to reverse
- Making a decision that future developers will question
