# Plan Document Templates

Read this when writing the Phase 2 documents. Create files in `plans/<feature-name>/`. Stamp `00-index.md` and `99-execution-plan.md` with `> **CodeOps Artifact Schema**: 1`. Every `[Date]` / `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]` placeholder is filled from `date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M'` — never an invented timestamp.

Folder layout:

```
plans/<feature-name>/

├── 00-index.md
├── 01-requirements.md

## Reference, don't restate (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Every behavioral fact, decision, or specification lives in exactly ONE owning document:

| Fact type | Owning doc |
|-----------|-----------|
| Requirement / scope decision | the RD (when the plan implements one), else `01-requirements.md` |
| Design / architecture / signatures / error handling | the governing `03-XX` doc |
| Expected test behavior (input→output) | `07-testing-strategy.md` (ST-cases) |
| Resolved ambiguity | `00-ambiguity-register.md` (AR entries) |

Every other document CITES the owner — `ST-4..ST-7`, `03-01 §Parsing`, `AR-12` — with at most a
**one-line gloss** for readability. Prohibited: copying acceptance detail into execution tasks,
re-deriving an RD inside plan documents, and **audit/traceability tables that restate AR or ST
content** (cite the numbers; the register/strategy doc IS the table). Execution-plan task lines
name the action + target file + citations; the executor reads the owning doc (or is handed the
excerpt at dispatch time — excerpting for a handoff packet is not restatement).

## 01-requirements.md — Requirements and Scope

Two variants — pick by whether the plan implements an RD (per "Reference, don't restate").

### RD-based plans — thin delta form

When the plan implements an RD, the RD is the OWNING requirements doc and `01-requirements.md`
is a delta view only — never a restatement:

```markdown
# Requirements: [Feature Name]

> **Document**: 01-requirements.md
> **Parent**: [Index](00-index.md)
> **Source**: [RD-XX](../../requirements/RD-XX-feature-name.md) — the OWNING requirements doc

## Scope of this plan (delta view)

### In this plan
- RD-XX R1, R3–R5 [one-line gloss each]

### Deferred / out of this plan
- RD-XX R2 [why]

## Plan-local decisions

| Decision | Chosen | AR Ref |
| -------- | ------ | ------ |
| [Only decisions NOT already in the RD] | [Outcome] | AR #X |

## Acceptance Criteria

[Only plan-local criteria; the RD owns its own acceptance criteria]
```

### Standalone plans — full form

With no RD upstream, `01-requirements.md` IS the owning requirements doc:

```markdown
# Requirements: [Feature Name]

> **Document**: 01-requirements.md
> **Parent**: [Index](00-index.md)

## Feature Overview

[Detailed description of the feature]

## Functional Requirements

### Must Have

### Won't Have (Out of Scope)
- Exclusion 1

## Technical Requirements

### Performance

### Compatibility
- [Compatibility requirements]

### Security

## Scope Decisions

| Decision   | Options Considered | Chosen | Rationale | AR Ref |
| ---------- | ------------------ | ------ | --------- | ------ |
| [Decision] | A, B, C            | B      | [Why]     | AR #X  |

> **Traceability:** Every scope decision must reference the Ambiguity Register entry (AR #) that resolved it. See `00-ambiguity-register.md`.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. [ ] Criterion 1
2. [ ] All tests pass
3. [ ] Documentation updated

## Error Handling

| Error Case | Handling Strategy | AR Ref |
| ---------- | ----------------- | ------ |
| [Error]    | [Strategy]        | AR #X  |

> **Traceability:** Every error-handling strategy and design choice must reference the Ambiguity Register entry (AR #) that resolved it. See `00-ambiguity-register.md`. Only exceptions: universally obvious facts and zero-semantic-impact formatting.

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for [specific functionality]
- Integration tests for [interactions]
```

**Component document sizing:** one `03-XX-[component].md` per major component, or split into `03-XX-[component]-[sub].md` per sub-component. Keep each document manageable to author (aim well under ~30K tokens to write).

## 07-testing-strategy.md — Testing Strategy

```markdown
# Testing Strategy: [Feature Name]

> **Document**: 07-testing-strategy.md
> **Parent**: [Index](00-index.md)

## Testing Overview

### Coverage Goals

| Code type | Target |
| --------- | ------ |
| Core business logic | 90% |
| Supporting modules / services | 80% |
| UI / glue / configuration | 60% |

- Test names state behavior: `should [expected behavior] when [condition]`.
- Integration tests: key workflows covered. E2E tests: complete feature verification.
- Adjust targets per project in `01-requirements.md` (an AR-referenced decision) — never
  silently.

## 🚨 Specification Test Cases (MANDATORY — NON-NEGOTIABLE)

> These test cases are derived EXCLUSIVELY from requirements (`01-requirements.md`),
> component specs (`03-XX-*.md`), API contracts, RFCs, and the Ambiguity Register
> (`00-ambiguity-register.md`). They define expected behavior BEFORE any implementation exists.
>
> **IMMUTABLE ORACLE RULE:** Do NOT modify these expectations to match the implementation.
> If the implementation does not match a spec test case, the implementation is wrong — not the test.
>
> **Every spec test case MUST include a source reference** tracing it to the requirement,
> spec document, or AR entry that defines the expected behavior.
>
> The `Source` column lives **in this plan document** — it is not a code comment. When the
> executor turns an ST-case into a `.spec.test` file, the test's in-code traceability comment
> quotes the behavior in **plain language** (e.g. `// password must be at least 8 characters`),
> **never** the `Source` cell's `ST-`/`Req`/`AR #` id or a `requirements/` path — per the
> standards' Documentation ban (the planning folder is ephemeral; the test must stand alone).

### [Component/Feature 1]

| #    | Input / Scenario           | Expected Output / Behavior             | Source            |
|------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------|
| ST-1 | [Concrete input or action] | [Concrete expected output or behavior] | [Req X.X / AR #X] |
| ST-2 | [Concrete input or action] | [Concrete expected output or behavior] | [Req X.X / AR #X] |
| ST-3 | [Error/edge scenario]      | [Expected error type and message]      | [Req X.X / AR #X] |

> **⚠️ AUTHORING RULE:** Derive expectations from the specification documents above. Do NOT
> imagine or infer what the implementation will produce. If the expected output cannot be
> determined from the spec, that is an ambiguity — add it to the Ambiguity Register and
> resolve it with the user before defining the test case.
>
> In a repo with an active quality profile these ST-case rows are excerpted **verbatim** into
> the spec-test-author agent's packet — excerpting is packeting, not restatement, so keep each
> row self-contained.

## 99-execution-plan.md — Execution Plan

Every execution plan MUST follow this template, MUST carry each phase's tasks as a single
checkbox list (the plan's **single source of truth** for progress — a task line appears exactly
once in the document), and MUST structure feature phases with the specification-first ordering
(see the next section).

````markdown
# Execution Plan: [Feature Name]

> **Document**: 99-execution-plan.md
> **Parent**: [Index](00-index.md)
> **Last Updated**: [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]
> **Progress**: 0/X tasks (0%)
> **CodeOps Artifact Schema**: 1

## Overview

[Brief description of the feature implementation]

**🚨 Update this document after EACH completed task!**

---

## Implementation Phases

| Phase | Title          | Tasks |
| ----- | -------------- | ----- |
| 1     | [Phase 1 Name] | X     |
| 2     | [Phase 2 Name] | X     |

**Total: X tasks across Y phases** (no fabricated hour estimates — scope is bounded by the
task-size criteria in [quality-checklist.md](quality-checklist.md))

> **⚠️ EXECUTION RULE — APPLIES TO EVERY AGENT EXECUTING THIS PLAN:**
>
> The task checkboxes in the phase sections below are the **single source of truth** for
> progress. Every task line appears exactly once in this document. The executing agent MUST:
>
> 1. **On implementation:** mark the task `[~]` with a timestamp —
>    `- [~] 1.1.1 Task description ⏳ (implemented: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM)`
> 2. **On verify pass:** promote it to `[x]` —
>    `- [x] 1.1.1 Task description ✅ (completed: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM)`
> 3. **Update the Progress header** (`> **Progress**: X/Y tasks (Z%)`) and the Last Updated
>    stamp after EVERY task — never batch updates. Only `[x]` counts as complete.
> 4. **Resume** by scanning the phase sections top-to-bottom: the first `[~]` task is resumed
>    first, else the first `[ ]` task.
>
> Timestamps come from `date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M'` — never invented. Failure to keep the marks
> current means progress is invisible after crashes, context resets, or session handoffs.

## Phase 1: [Phase Name]

> **Phase ref**: _(recorded by the exec-plan skill at phase start — `git rev-parse HEAD`)_
> **Lenses**: [add-on lenses — include this line only when the target repo carries a quality
> profile; informational: activation stays profile-driven]

### Step 1.1: [Step Objective]

**Reference**: [Governing 03-doc §section] · [AR #s]
**Objective**: [What this step achieves]

- [ ] 1.1.1 [spec-author] Write specification tests from the 07 ST-cases — `[feature].spec.test.[ext]`
- [ ] 1.1.2 [Task description] — `path/to/file`

> Mark spec-test tasks with `[spec-author]`: in a repo with an active quality profile, the
> exec-plan skill dispatches the spec-test-author agent for them (packet per
> `_shared/quality-profile.md`); without a profile the marker is inert and the session writes
> the tests itself.

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] Deliverable 1
- [ ] All verification passing

**Verify**: [Project's verify command from AGENTS.md / detected conventions]

6. ✅ Documentation updated
7. ✅ Code reviewed (if applicable)
8. ✅ Post-completion project re-analysis (handled by the exec-plan skill)
````

> Detailed session-by-session execution mechanics (commit modes, real-time progress updates, post-completion re-analysis) belong to the **exec-plan skill**, not here.

## Specification-First Task Ordering (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Every feature implementation phase in `99-execution-plan.md` MUST follow the three-step
specification-first ordering — `spec tests → red phase → implement → green phase → impl tests →
verify` — defined ONCE in **[../../_shared/spec-first-ordering.md](../../_shared/spec-first-ordering.md)**.
Read it before authoring the execution plan; it carries the full step structure, the compressed
small-feature form, the prohibited/required lists, and the immutable-oracle rule. Generated plans
must reference `07-testing-strategy.md` ST-cases in spec-test tasks and include a distinct
red-phase verification task.
