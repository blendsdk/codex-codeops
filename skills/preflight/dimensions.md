# Preflight — The 13-Dimension Scan (detail)

> **CodeOps Artifact Schema**: 1

Read this file before executing Step 3 of the protocol — and especially before auditing a plan,
where Dimension 13 (Codebase Alignment) carries the most weight. Steps 1 and 2 set up the scan;
this file covers reconnaissance detail and the full dimension definitions.

## Step 1: Load and understand the artifact

Before scanning, you MUST:

1. **Read the complete artifact** — every document, section, and line.
2. **Identify the artifact type** — requirements set, implementation plan, or ad-hoc document.
3. **Load context** — read the project's AGENTS.md (or detected project conventions); understand
   the tech stack, conventions, and constraints.
4. **Read the Ambiguity Register** (if one exists) — `requirements/00-ambiguity-register.md` or
   `plans/<name>/00-ambiguity-register.md`. Understand what decisions were already made and why.
5. **Freeze the scope** — record the exact audit target, context documents, and authorized
   modification set. Reading a related document does not add it to the target.
6. **Resolve graph identity** — when traceability exists, use the exact node/group target with
   the `audit` gate. Closure is context; findings do not silently expand the modification set.

## Step 2: Codebase Reconnaissance — 🚨 NON-NEGOTIABLE

This step is what separates a real preflight from a document-correction exercise. Without it, every
dimension scan is blind. Build a thorough understanding of the actual codebase the artifact targets.

### What to examine

| What to examine | Why | How |
|---|---|---|
| **Project structure** | Understand what exists, how code is organized | List files on the project root recursively; read the directory layout |
| **Entry points & main modules** | Understand architecture and flow | Read main/index files, server bootstrap, CLI entry points |
| **Type definitions & interfaces** | Understand the data model and contracts | Read type files, interface definitions, shared types |
| **Key source files** | Understand implementation patterns and conventions | Read files directly relevant to the artifact's scope |
| **Existing tests** | Understand test patterns, what's already covered | Read test dirs, test helpers, test config |
| **Package manifest & dependencies** | Understand available libraries | Read `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, `pyproject.toml`, etc. |
| **Configuration files** | Understand build, deploy, runtime setup | Read tsconfig, webpack, docker-compose, CI/CD configs |
| **Existing documentation** | Understand what's already documented | Read README, CHANGELOG, architecture docs |

### Depth of reconnaissance by artifact type

| Artifact type | Reconnaissance depth |
|---|---|
| **Requirements** | Moderate — understand architecture, patterns, and existing capabilities to assess feasibility and non-redundancy |
| **Implementation Plan** | Deep — read every file the plan proposes to modify or depend on; verify every component/API/pattern reference; understand the dependency graph around the affected area |
| **Ad-hoc Document** | Targeted — focus on the specific area the document addresses |

> Reconnaissance is proportional, not exhaustive. For a plan that modifies 3 files, read those 3
> files deeply plus their direct dependents — do not read the entire codebase for a small artifact.
> For a single-RD or single-plan-document audit, related artifacts are context only. Use them to
> prove or refute claims in the target; do not turn defects located solely in those documents into
> findings against the selected artifact.

### Mapping document references to code

Systematically map every reference in the artifact to actual code:

- Every **component, module, or service** → Does it exist? Where? What does it actually do?
- Every **file or directory path** → Does it exist? Is the path correct?
- Every **API, function, or class** → Does it exist? Does its signature match what's assumed?
- Every **pattern or convention** assumed → Is it actually used in the codebase?
- Every **dependency or library** referenced → Is it in the manifest? Right version?
- Every **existing behavior** described → Is that actually how the code works?

Any reference that cannot be verified against the code is a potential finding for the scan.

## Step 3: The 13 dimensions

Scan all 13 every time, with adversarial intent. Every check must be informed by Step 2.

| # | Dimension | What to hunt for |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Ambiguities** | Vague language, undefined terms, weasel words ("appropriate", "as needed", "etc."), statements with multiple interpretations, undefined behaviors |
| 2 | **Implicit Assumptions** | Things taken for granted without stating, assumed capabilities/knowledge/environment. **Codebase check:** verify every assumption about the code — assumed APIs, data models, patterns, capabilities that may not exist or behave differently |
| 3 | **Logical Contradictions** | Statements that conflict — across documents, sections, or within a paragraph. Inconsistent decisions, conflicting constraints |
| 4 | **Completeness Gaps** | Missing requirements, unaddressed journeys, absent error handling, undefined edge cases, features mentioned but never specified, missing acceptance criteria. **Codebase check:** existing code/tests/functionality affected by the changes but not mentioned — missing impact analysis |
| 5 | **Dependency Issues** | Circular/missing dependencies, dependencies on undefined components, tasks referencing not-yet-created entities, broken chains. **Codebase check:** verify referenced dependencies against the actual manifest and import graph — exist? right versions? undeclared deps relied on? |
| 6 | **Feasibility Concerns** | Tasks possibly impossible/unrealistic, underestimated complexity, approaches incompatible with the stated stack, tasks too large to do atomically. **Codebase check:** verify approaches against the actual architecture — will it work with how the code is structured? Do estimates match the real code? Unaccounted-for architectural constraints? |
| 7 | **Testability** | Requirements/tasks with no clear way to verify success, vague criteria ("should work well"), missing test specs, untestable acceptance criteria |
| 8 | **Security Blind Spots** | Missing authn/authz, unvalidated inputs, exposed sensitive data, unaddressed threat vectors, missing rate limiting, insecure defaults |
| 9 | **Edge Cases** | Unaddressed boundary conditions, unhandled failure modes, ignored concurrency, undefined empty/null/zero states, missing overflow/underflow |
| 10 | **Scope Creep Indicators** | Items exceeding stated scope, unbounded tasks ("support all formats"), features implying entire sub-systems, gold-plating, premature optimization |
| 11 | **Ordering & Sequencing** | Tasks in wrong order, phases that should swap, work planned before its dependencies exist, missing foundation work. **Codebase check:** verify order against the actual dependency graph — real module boundaries, import chains, build dependencies |
| 12 | **Consistency** | Naming inconsistencies across documents, conflicting conventions, terminology drift (same thing, different names), formatting that obscures meaning |
| 13 | **Codebase Alignment** | **The master reality check.** Entirely codebase-grounded — see below |

### Dimension 13: Codebase Alignment — detailed sub-checks

Every sub-check requires completed Step 2 reconnaissance and must reference specific files/code.

| Sub-check | What to hunt for | Example finding |
|---|---|---|
| **Phantom References** | Components/files/APIs/modules/classes/functions mentioned that do not exist | "Plan references `UserAuthService` in phase 3, but no such class exists. The actual auth logic is in `middleware/auth.ts` as a function chain." |
| **Stale Assumptions** | Incorrect claims about how existing code works — wrong signatures, data flows, behavior | "RD-05 states 'the cache layer supports TTL per key' but `CacheManager.set()` has no TTL param — it uses a global TTL from config." |
| **Architecture Mismatch** | Proposed patterns/structures that conflict with the established architecture | "Plan proposes a class-based service layer, but the codebase uses a pure-function pattern — every existing 'service' is an exported function." |
| **Impact Blindness** | Existing code affected by the changes but not acknowledged | "Plan modifies the `User` interface in `types/index.ts` but doesn't mention the 14 files that import it, 6 of which would break." |
| **Redundancy** | Things the document proposes to build that already exist | "RD-12 calls for 'a utility to parse env vars with defaults' — this already exists as `resolveConfig()` in `src/config.ts`." |
| **Test Impact** | Existing tests that would break/become invalid, or test patterns the doc doesn't follow | "The plan adds a new tool but ignores the existing pattern in `tools-setup.ts` where all tools share a lazy-loaded store fixture." |
| **Dependency Reality** | Assumed-available libs that aren't installed, or installed libs the doc ignores that could solve its problem | "Phase 2 proposes adding `lodash` for deep merge, but it isn't in dependencies. The project already has a custom `deepMerge` in `utils/`." |
| **Convention Violations** | Proposed naming/organization/patterns that violate actual conventions | "Plan names the new file `getUserData.ts` but the project uses kebab-case: `get-rule.ts`, `search-rules.ts`." |
| **Scope vs. Reality** | Complexity/effort estimates unrealistic given the actual code | "Plan estimates phase 4 (refactor caching) as 'straightforward, ~100 lines' but the cache spans 3 files, 450 lines, with 40 dependent tests." |
| **Migration & Compatibility** | Missing data migration plans, backwards-compat concerns, or rollback strategies | "Plan changes the config file format but doesn't address migration for existing users on the old format." |

**Rules for Dimension 13 findings:**

- Cite the **specific file(s) and line(s)** that contradict or invalidate the artifact's claims.
- Explain the **actual state** of the code, not just that it's "different".
- Phantom-reference findings MUST suggest what the document **probably meant** if there's a close match.
- Impact-blindness findings MUST list the **affected files** and how they'd be impacted.
