# Preflight — Report Format, Presentation & Persistence (detail)

> **CodeOps Artifact Schema**: 1

Covers Steps 4-8 of the protocol: compiling the report, presenting findings and collecting
decisions, pass/fail determination, applying fixes, and roadmap sync — plus iterative re-scan
numbering, report persistence, and same-agent-bias safeguards.

## Step 4: Compile the Preflight Report

Every finding gets a numbered, structured entry.

### Finding template

```markdown
### PF-[NNN]: [Finding Title] [severity-icon] [SEVERITY]

**Dimension:** [Which of the 13 dimensions]
**Location:** [File path + section/line reference in the artifact]
**Codebase Evidence:** [File path + line reference in the actual code, if applicable]
**The Problem:** [Clear, specific description of what's wrong and WHY it matters]

**Options:**

| Option | Description | Pros | Cons |
|--------|-------------|------|------|
| A | [Description] | [Pros] | [Cons] |
| B | [Description] | [Pros] | [Cons] |
| C | [Description] | [Pros] | [Cons] |

**Recommendation:** Option [X] — [concise rationale]

**User Decision:** Pending
```

**Rules for findings:**

- **Options must be genuinely viable, never strawmen** — present ≥2 options only when ≥2 are
  genuinely viable. When one resolution clearly dominates, present it alone, state it is the only
  viable one, and name what you considered and dropped and why. Never pad to a count to manufacture
  a choice.
- **Every finding MUST have a recommendation, with rationale** — never just "Option B is better".
- **High-stakes findings (CRITICAL/MAJOR) get the hardening challenger — ONE per preflight scan,
  not one per finding.** Per `_shared/recommendation-hardening.md` (challenger budget): spawn a
  single challenger that receives the whole CRITICAL/MAJOR finding batch (statement + surviving
  options per finding, without your picks) PLUS the scan's Codebase Context summary, and returns
  per-finding verdicts to reconcile *before* recording recommendations. Hard cap: 2 challenger
  spawns per scan. Close findings with the `Confidence:` / `Hardening:` disclosure where that
  protocol requires it (Med/Low confidence, changed pick, or high stakes — presentation-only,
  not a required saved field).
- **Findings are numbered sequentially by root cause** — `PF-001`, `PF-002`, ... A reopened root
  cause retains its identifier across iterations; a new root cause gets the next unused number.
- **Location must be specific** — "plans/my-feature/03-api-design.md, section 'Error Handling'", not
  "somewhere in the plan".
- **Codebase Evidence is required** for findings in dimensions 2, 4, 5, 6, 11, and 13 — cite the
  actual file and code. For other dimensions, include it when relevant. If you can't verify a claim
  against the code, say so: "Unable to verify against the codebase; this finding is based on the
  document alone."

### Report header template

```markdown
## Preflight Report: [Artifact Name]

> **Status**: REVIEW IN PROGRESS — [X] findings ([C] critical, [M] major, [m] minor, [O] observation)
> **Iteration**: [N] (first scan / re-scan after fixes)
> **Artifact**: [type] at [path]
> **Codebase Grounded**: [N] source files examined, [M] references verified
> **Last Updated**: [Date]

### Codebase Context Summary

**Tech Stack:** [actual stack from manifest]
**Architecture:** [brief architecture description from code examination]
**Key Files Examined:** [list of most relevant files read during reconnaissance]

### Summary by Dimension

| # | Dimension | Findings | Highest Severity |
|---|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| 1 | Ambiguities | [count] | [icon] |
| 2 | Implicit Assumptions | [count] | [icon] |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
| 13 | Codebase Alignment | [count] | [icon] |

### Summary by Severity

| Severity | Count | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| CRITICAL | [N] | [all resolved? / X pending] |
| MAJOR | [N] | [all resolved? / X pending] |
| MINOR | [N] | [all resolved? / X pending] |
| OBSERVATION | [N] | [all resolved? / X pending] |

---

[Individual findings follow]
```

Use the severity icons from SKILL.md (red/orange/yellow/blue circles) in the actual report.

## Step 5: Present findings and collect decisions

1. **Present grouped by severity** — CRITICAL first, then MAJOR, MINOR, OBSERVATION.
2. **Present per the batch rules below** (they are authoritative for pacing) — each finding shown
   with problem, options, recommendation.
3. **Collect and record the user's decision for every finding** before the report is final:
   `**User Decision:** [their choice]`.

### Batch presentation rules

- **<= 5 findings** — present all at once, let the user respond to each.
- **6-15 findings** — present by severity group (all criticals, then all majors, etc.).
- **> 15 findings** — present in batches of 5-8, grouped by severity, wait for confirmation between batches.

**Previous decisions are respected (hard rule).** A finding that duplicates a decision already
recorded in the artifact's Ambiguity Register — including a named `⏸ Deferred` row — is NOT
re-presented for decision: record it as `Accepted Risk — deferred per AR #N` (or cross-reference
the resolving AR #) and move on. Re-litigating decisions the user already made is a protocol
violation, not thoroughness.

### Agent behavior during resolution

| User says | Agent response |
|---|---|
| "Fix it per your recommendation" | Record `Resolved — User accepted recommendation: [Option X]`. Valid. |
| "Go with Option A" | Record `Resolved — User chose Option A`. |
| "This isn't actually an issue" | Record `Dismissed — User: "[reasoning]"`. Valid — only the user can dismiss. |
| "I'll fix this later" | Ask to record as a known accepted risk (won't block the pass but noted). If yes: `Accepted Risk — User deferred: "[reason]"` — the preflight face of the shared `⏸ Deferred` status (`_shared/zero-ambiguity-gate.md`); name the decision, owner, and revisit-trigger in the reason. |
| "You decide" | "I've given my recommendation above. Confirm you'd like Option [X]?" — user MUST explicitly confirm. |

## Step 6: Determine pass/fail

See the Pass tiers table in SKILL.md. A clean first-scan pass is a valid outcome — never invent
findings to justify the review.

## Step 7: Apply fixes (only if requested)

The user may ask the agent to apply fixes:

- **"Apply all fixes"** — modify the artifact documents per the resolved findings (normal file writes).
- **"Apply fixes for PF-003 and PF-007"** — apply specific fixes only.
- **"I'll fix them myself"** — do nothing; the report is a checklist.
- **"Apply fixes and re-scan"** — apply, then immediately run another iteration.

> The agent MUST NOT apply fixes without explicit instruction. Preflight is a **review** protocol,
> not a **modification** protocol. Finding issues and fixing issues are separate steps.

## Step 8: Roadmap sync

After a preflight **pass**, sync the roadmap via the roadmap skill if one is in play:

- **If `plans/00-roadmap.md` exists:** advance the audited target's row —
  - an **RD** that passed → stage `RD Preflighted`
  - a **plan** that passed → stage `Plan Preflighted`

  Update the row's `Stage`, `Status`, and `Last Updated` (update-first mandate).
- **If `plans/00-roadmap.md` does NOT exist:** these hooks are inert — no error, no auto-creation.

A BLOCKED outcome does NOT advance the roadmap. See the roadmap skill for the full protocol.

## Iterative re-scanning

### How iterations work

1. **Iteration 1** — full 13-dimension scan of the original artifact (with full reconnaissance).
2. **Fixes applied** — user resolves findings (manually or via "apply fixes").
3. **Iteration 2** — re-scan focusing on: **verify fixes** (each resolved finding actually fixed),
   **regression check** (fixes introduced no new issues), **bounded fresh scan** (re-examine all 13
   within the unchanged audit target), and **codebase re-check** (re-verify changed references).
4. **Iteration 3, only when blocking defects remain** — inspect the unresolved 🔴/🟠 fixes and their
   direct dependency surface. Do not restart broad discovery.
5. **Iteration 4+** — never automatic. Recommend a fresh-session audit to counter accumulated
   framing bias, or obtain an explicit user decision to continue the current session.

### Re-scan numbering

Finding identifiers name root causes, not scan appearances:

- a verified fix closes its existing `PF-NNN`;
- a partial fix, residual contradiction, or regression with the same root cause reopens that
  `PF-NNN` and adds an `Iteration N evidence` note;
- a genuinely independent root cause receives the next unused number; and
- merged or split symptoms retain a `Related findings` link so the audit trail stays navigable.

Do not relabel a residual form of an old defect as a new finding merely to keep numbering
continuous.

### Re-scan report header

```markdown
## Preflight Report: [Artifact Name] — Iteration [N]

> **Status**: [status]
> **Previous Iteration**: [X] findings — [all resolved / Y carried forward]
> **This Iteration**: [Z] new findings
> **Carried Forward**: [list of PF-### still open from previous iterations]
```

### Convergence

Use severity and decision state, not the desire for a zero-finding scan:

| State after verification | Result |
|---|---|
| Any unresolved 🔴/🟠 | **Blocked**; a bounded corrective rescan is allowed |
| No unresolved 🔴/🟠; one or more 🟡 pending | Collect decisions; do not rescan yet |
| No unresolved 🔴/🟠; all remaining 🟡 explicitly accepted | **Passed With Notes**; stop |
| Only 🔵 observations remain | **Passed With Notes**; stop unless the user requests fixes |
| No findings remain | **Passed — Clean**; stop |
| User stops with unresolved 🔴/🟠 | **Blocked**; record the stop without advancing the roadmap |

Applying an accepted minor or observation does not by itself justify another full scan. Verify that
edit directly; run another bounded scan only when the edit changes behavior, ownership, dependency
ordering, security, compatibility, or another consequential contract.

Before plan creation or execution consumes a passed artifact, compare its current git blob (or
content hash when it is uncommitted) with the revision recorded by preflight. A mismatch makes the
pass stale and requires a targeted re-check of the changed sections; it does not silently trigger a
set-wide audit.

## Report persistence

Save the report alongside the artifact (locations in SKILL.md). It is a permanent audit trail.

### Relationship to the Ambiguity Register

Separate documents with different purposes:

| Document | Created by | Purpose | Contains |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Ambiguity Register** (`00-ambiguity-register.md`) | make-plan / make-requirements skills | Track decisions made DURING creation | User decisions on design choices |
| **Preflight Report** (`00-preflight-report.md`) | preflight | Track issues found DURING review | Post-creation defects, gaps, codebase misalignments, and resolutions |

When a finding relates to an existing Ambiguity Register entry, cross-reference it:

```markdown
**Related:** AR #7 decided on JWT auth, but this finding identifies a gap
in the token refresh flow that AR #7 didn't cover.
```

Do not re-litigate an Ambiguity Register decision unless new information invalidates it — reference
the AR entry and explain what changed.

## Same-agent bias awareness — NON-NEGOTIABLE

When the same model created the artifact and reviews it, systematic blind spots are likely — shared
training biases, knowledge gaps, and reasoning patterns. A bug missed during creation is exactly
the kind of bug that will be missed during review. Structural safeguards:

1. **Fresh context required** — if the artifact was created in the CURRENT session, note it at the
   top of the report:
   ```
   SAME-SESSION REVIEW: This artifact was created in the current session.
   Same-agent bias risk is elevated. Consider running preflight in a new session
   for maximum review independence.
   ```
2. **Standard-first checking** — for any behavior that must conform to an external standard (RFC,
   protocol, spec, regulation), verify by **citing the specific standard text**, not from memory.
   If you can't cite it, flag the limitation:
   ```
   Unable to verify conformance with [standard] — agent does not have
   access to the full standard text. Flag for human review.
   ```
3. **Adversarial question checklist** — before concluding the scan, ask yourself:
   - "What assumption did I make during creation that I might be unconsciously confirming now?"
   - "What external standard or convention might this violate that I'm not aware of?"
   - "What would a domain expert who disagrees with my approach flag as wrong?"
   If any surface concerns, add them as observation findings.
4. **User recommendation** — if the artifact is high-stakes (security/compliance/architecturally
   foundational), recommend: "Consider having a human domain expert review this in addition to
   the automated preflight."
