# Quality Profile (shared convention)

> **CodeOps Skills Version**: 3.12.0

This is the **single canonical definition** of the per-repo quality profile and the quality-agent
conventions built on it. It lives at the plugin root in `_shared/`; dispatching skills link here
instead of carrying copies.

## Structured profile

Quality and routing configuration lives in `codeops/codeops.json`, validated against
`schemas/codeops-config.schema.json`. `AGENTS.md` contains project guidance, not mutable machine
configuration.

The quality section controls independent review and stop conditions. The routing section controls
optional roles, effort, model pins, sandboxes, and concurrency. Domain/risk tags in the active
specification select additional reviewer roles. Outcome metrics are disabled unless
`metrics.enabled` is explicitly `true`.

### Parsing, absence, and ownership

- Missing quality configuration selects strict CodeOps defaults for planned complex-system work:
  independent review on, at least one reviewer, and stop on major findings.
- Invalid structured configuration is a readiness blocker; do not silently discard malformed
  policy and continue with unknown guarantees.
- setup-routing proposes and updates structured policy. Hand edits are valid and validated.
- A missing optional custom agent never disables review; use a complete dynamic packet or inline
  fallback.

## Taxonomies

### Lens enum (7 — grow-only; renaming or repurposing an existing value is forbidden)

| Lens | Scope (one line) |
|------|------------------|
| `correctness` | Logic errors, broken behavior against the spec and tests. **Base.** |
| `maintainability` | Design-quality judgment calls: clarity, structure, duplication, naming. **Base.** |
| `standards` | Violations of the always-on written coding standards. **Base-only — never a valid profile add-on.** |
| `security` | Injection, authorization, secrets handling, unsafe input. Add-on. |
| `perf` | Hot paths, allocations, algorithmic complexity, blocking I/O. Add-on. |
| `api-surface` | Public interface design, compatibility, versioning. Add-on. |
| `concurrency` | Races, locking, ordering — explicitly **owns data-integrity**. Add-on. |

The base lenses `correctness` + `maintainability` + `standards` are always on for every review;
the profile's `lenses` list names **add-ons only**. Disambiguation: a violation of a written
standard is `standards`; a design-quality judgment with no written rule behind it is
`maintainability` — keeping the two distinguishable in findings and outcome evidence.

### security_profile enum (5)

| Profile | Focus |
|---------|-------|
| `owasp-web` | Classic web-app risks: injection, XSS, CSRF, broken access control, SSRF |
| `auth-protocol` | Authentication/session flows: token handling, expiry, replay, fixation |
| `financial-integrity` | Money movement: idempotency, double-spend, rounding, audit trails |
| `tenant-isolation` | Multi-tenant boundaries: cross-tenant reads/writes, scoping, leakage |
| `mcp-agent` | Agent/MCP integrations: prompt injection, tool abuse, secret exfiltration |

The per-profile checklists live in `agent-templates/security-auditor.md`; this table is the naming
authority. Both enums are grow-only: adding a value here legalizes it everywhere (the structural
guards read the enums from this file).

### Severity

Findings reuse the preflight severity scale **by reference** — 🔴 CRITICAL / 🟠 MAJOR /
🟡 MINOR as defined in the preflight skill — verbatim, with no extra levels.

### Finding prefixes

RV (phase-reviewer) · SA (security-auditor) · PA (preflight-auditor) · PE (perf-auditor), each
numbered `XX-NNN`. Every finding-producing agent reports "no findings" explicitly rather than
returning empty output.

## Activation & supersession

| Condition | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| No structured profile | Strict defaults: one correctness review for every non-trivial executed phase |
| `quality.independentReview: false` | Allowed only outside strict mode; announce that independent review is disabled |
| Independent review on | Post-phase quality review runs for **all executed phases and task mini-plans** (whole-task diff); trivial tasks are never reviewed |
| Docs-only diff | Phase reviewer still runs; security/perf auditors skip — the skip is logged, never silent |
| Security risk tags active | Security auditor dispatches once per phase with the union of applicable checklists and supersedes the reviewer's security lens |
| Performance-critical tag + code diff | Performance auditor dispatches and supersedes the reviewer's performance lens |

Supersession exists so the same ground is never reviewed twice at different depths: a dedicated
agent replaces the reviewer's matching add-on lens for that phase.

## Dispatch packets & header

**Line 1 of every quality-agent dispatch prompt** is a compact scope header:

```
[codeops-dispatch agent=<name> feature=<slug> phase=<id>]
```

The header makes parallel results attributable and auditable. Outcome metrics never parse prompt
or response content.

| Agent | Packet contents (the agent receives nothing else and must need nothing else) |
|-------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| phase-reviewer, security-auditor, perf-auditor | Phase diff (`git diff <phase-start-ref>..HEAD`), the phase's task + Deliverable lines, active lenses, profile excerpt, verify command + last result |
| spec-test-author | Spec excerpts + test cases, planned interface signatures from the plan documents, test framework/conventions, the FORBIDDEN implementation-file list, verify command (expected RED) |
| preflight-auditor | The artifact under audit + ONE assigned dimension cluster |
| design-challenger | Problem + candidate options, **without** the parent's preferred choice (per `_shared/recommendation-hardening.md`) |
| codebase-scout | The factual questions, search hints, and the facts-only contract |

## Budget caps

- **Preflight fan-out:** ~5 clustered auditor dispatches — an exact partition of the preflight
  skill's 13 dimensions, grouped by affinity: ① Ambiguities + Logical Contradictions +
  Consistency (document soundness) · ② Implicit Assumptions + Codebase Alignment (grounding) ·
  ③ Completeness Gaps + Dependency Issues + Ordering & Sequencing (delivery) · ④ Security Blind
  Spots + Edge Cases + Feasibility Concerns (risk) · ⑤ Testability + Scope Creep Indicators
  (fit). `--thorough` expands to one dispatch per dimension.
- **Re-review:** at most ONE re-review per phase, only after 🔴/🟠 fixes, scoped to the fix
  diff — never a third pass.
- **Scout:** ≤3 codebase-scout dispatches per skill run, enforced by the dispatching parent.
- **Challenger:** caps live in `_shared/recommendation-hardening.md` and apply unchanged.

## Model, effort, and agent resolution

Routing policy lives in `codeops/codeops.json`; see the setup-routing skill. Policy names roles and capabilities, not vendor tiers. A role may optionally declare a current Codex model, reasoning effort, and sandbox, but no gate depends on a particular model being available.

Resolution order is:

1. an explicit model/effort requested for the current dispatch;
2. a generated or hand-authored project agent in `.codex/agents/<role>.toml`;
3. project `[agents]` defaults in `.codex/config.toml`;
4. the parent session's model and effort.

Use `python3 "${PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/install_agents.py" --project . --roles ...` to create optional project agents. Generated TOML files carry a CodeOps marker. The installer owns only marked files and preserves every hand-authored file. Use `--check` to detect missing or stale generated agents and `--dry-run` to preview changes.

Dynamic packets are the correctness baseline. If a named agent is missing or a model pin is unavailable, spawn a generic subagent with the complete packet or run inline. Report the fallback and preserve required reviewer independence, sandbox intent, and every ambiguity/readiness/verification gate.
